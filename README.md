# Principal Component Analysis Documentation

### What is PCA?
Principal component analysis is a clustering algorithm to reduce dimensionality of data. This tool was designed to reduce the dimensionality of SNP genotypes. The output will be a cluster graph of these SNP genotypes.  

The pipeline includes taking a vcf file, performing clustering analysis of the variants, and outputting a graph to show the analysis of the genome in the vcf file.
